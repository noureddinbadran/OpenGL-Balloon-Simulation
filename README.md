# Simulation of Google Balloon Project(Loon)
## Overview
 Loon LLC is an Alphabet Inc. subsidiary working on providing Internet access to rural and remote areas. The company uses high-altitude balloons in the stratosphere at an altitude of 18 km to 25 km to create an aerial wireless network with up to 1 Mbps speeds.
 
## About the simulation
In this project will simulate how the ballon fly in the atmospher layers untill reachs to the specific layer, and we simulate all different physical factors which would the ballon exposed to it.

## Tools
We have used C++ graphics library(OpenGL)

## Dependencies
You need to have on your local machine the following things:

- **Visual Studio 2012 or 2013(Recommended)** to build & run the project.

- **OpenGL files** to run the project successfully
I have attached all needed files within the project under the "Dependencies\OpenGL_FIles" directory, so let's put it in the right place:
1st: Take all files with extension ".lib" and put them into the following directory:
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\lib
2nd: Take all files with extension ".h" and put them into the following directory:
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\include
3nd: Take all files with extension ".dll" and put them into the following directory:
    C:\Windows\System (in case if your OS is 64bit)
    C:\Windows\System32 (in case if your OS is 32bit)
  
## To run the project
  1st: Go to directory "Ghraphces  project" and extract "Data.rar"
  2nd: Open your VS and do clean & rebuild then run the project
  
## Note
  Under the directory "GUI LOON" there is a GUI had been built using C# for the project, so you can use it as a seperated GUI.
